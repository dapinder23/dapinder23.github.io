<h3>CPSC 120</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Lab 11</p>

<p>Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite in Lab 11 because I didn't know how the game was going to play out. Josh and I had to use time out of the class to solve 70 percent of the code
Me and my partner had to ask so many questions to get the right answer but it was satisfying at the end. https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-11-wesley-and-dapinder</p></li>
<li><p>Lab 10</p>

<p>Lab 10, we learned about the 50 states and how California was the most populous. I liked the fact how
we sorted the counties and had to find out the correct order. I learned how to organize using code and how to make the right order.

<li><p>Lab 4</p>

<p>Lab 4, I made a new friend in Lab 4 and I was not expecting that. The lab itself was all right but having the right partner
made this lab one of my favorite ones this whole semester. The main thing I learned from this lab is that team mates can become friends out side of work too.
